# NLP_projects
A repository of NLP projects I have worked on.

1. [Transfer learning in NLP for sentiment analysis](https://github.com/dipam7/NLP/blob/master/transfer_learning/sentiment_analysis_using_lm.ipynb)

In this notebook we start with a language model trained on wikipedia. We then train it on our own data and use the encoder part for sentiment analysis.

2. [Image captioning](https://github.com/dipam7/NLP/blob/master/Image_captioning/image_captioning.ipynb)

In image captioning, we train a CNN to extract features from images, and then feed that to an RNN to generate text from the same.

3. [Pubmed_RCT]()

In this project we use pubmed rct data to perform text classification
